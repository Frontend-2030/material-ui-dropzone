# material-ui-dropzone

**@pandemicode/material-ui-dropzone** a fork of **[Material-UI-Dropzone](https://github.com/Yuvaleros/material-ui-dropzone)** is a set of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) components using [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) and is based on the excellent [react-dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) library.

These components provide: 

- File Upload Dropzone
- File Upload Dropzone inside of a Dialog

Additionally, the File Upload Dropzone features some snazzy "File Allowed/Not Allowed" effects, previews and alerts.
